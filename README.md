## Manual

In case you want to check out this project, despite it being under heavy development, here are the steps to install, build, and start using.

> NOTE: These steps assume you already have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed. Also, these steps are tested on Linux (Arch amd64). But it should work just fine cross-platform.

git clone https://github.com/ElhamAryanpur/Hope

cd Hope

npm install
npm run build

# For Production (Recommended)
npm run production

# Otherwise
npm run server
```
